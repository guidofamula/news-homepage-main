## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS - Core Concepts](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states) - This helped me for handling hover, focus, and other states, using utilities to style elements on hover, focus, and more. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Next JS - How to setup in styling](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/assets-metadata-css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand assets, metadata and CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
